		  <p class="subtitle">This is a pretty versatile recipe. We use it for sandwich bread at 
          <a href="https://www.cornerpeach.com/"><strong>Corner Peach</strong></a> and 
          <a href="https://www.dukesottawa.com/"><strong>Dukes</strong></a>, and I've used it for burger buns or as the base of cinnamon rolls. 
          It freezes well and is incredibly forgiving. The sourdough starter in the recipe is optional — we just always had it on hand and found it added a little something different to the bread.

                <h2>Instructions</h2><br>
                <ol>
				    <li><strong>Make the Tangzong:</strong> Warm water and flour in a small pot over medium heat until a paste starts to form. It should start to look like loose mashed potatoes. Set aside to cool.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Make the dough:</strong>In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted add all the ingredients in order (including the tangzhong), except the butter. Mix the dough for 5 minutes on medium speed.</li><br>
                    <li>With the mixer running, add the butter in stages waiting until the butter is incorporated into the dough before adding more.</li><br>
                    <li>Once all the butter has been added continue to mix on medium for another 5 minutes</li><br>
                    <li>When finished mixing transfer dough to a lightly oiled container, cover and let proof until doubled in size. 60-90 minutes depending on temperature  of the room.</li><br>
					<li>When dough has doubled in size, grease two 9" loaf pans. Turn dough on clean work surface and portion into six equal pieces.</li><br>
					<li>Roll each piece into a ball and place into the prepared loaf pans. Three balls per loaf pan.</li><br>
					<li>Lightly oil the tops of the dough and cover pans loosely with plastic wrap. Allow to proof until the dough is beginning to come up over the lip of the pan. 30-60 minutes depending on tempature of the room. </li><br>
					<li>Set oven rack to the middle position and preheat oven to 350°F.</li><br>
					<li>Bake the loaves for 40 minutes, spinning halfway through, until golden brown and a thermometer inserted into the middle reads at least 190°F. For a crustier loaf, bake until  205°F.</li><br>
					<li>Allow to cool in the pans for 30 minutes or until cool enough to handle then remove loaves from pans and allow to finish cooling on a rack.</li><br>
					<li>If not eating right away, wrap the loaves well in plastic film and store for up to 4 days, at room temperature. You can also wrap in parchment, then plastic wrap and then aluminum foil and freeze them for up to 3 months. If freshly baked, be careful while wrapping so as not to crush your loaves (or freeze unwrapped for an hour before wrapping as directed).</li>
