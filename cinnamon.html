		  <p class="subtitle">We'd make these cinnamon buns every Saturday at <a href="https://www.cornerpeach.com/"><strong>Corner Peach</strong></a>, and they became a bit of a passion project to perfect. The recipe was based on one from <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/perfectly-pillowy-cinnamon-rolls-recipe"><strong>King Arthur Baking</strong></a>, but we wanted to make a sourdough version. This recipe is also a great way to use up discard from your sourdough starter. The yeast is doing the heavy lifting, so the starter is mostly there for flavor. The tanginess from the starter offsets the sweetness in the filling and frosting for a well-balanced bun. These buns take a while to make, but most of the time is spent waiting for the dough to rise—and they're well worth the wait!

                <h2>Instructions</h2><br>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Make the Tangzong:</strong> Warm milk and flour in a small pot over medium heat until a paste starts to form. It should start to look like loose mashed potatoes. Set aside to cool.</li><br>
                    
					<li><strong>Make the dough:</strong> In the bowl of a stand mixer combine the sourdough starter, milk, and yeast. Once yeast begins to foam add remaining dough ingredients along with the tangzhong. Using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 10–12 minutes. </li><br>
                    
					<li> Shape dough into a ball, place into a bowl and cover.</li><br>
                    
					<li> Let dough rise until puffy but not quite doubled in size. Between 60-90 minutes depending on the temperature of the room.</li><br>
                    
					<li><strong>Make the filling:</strong> While waiting for the dough to rise, melt butter and mix with remaining filling ingredients. It should look like wet sand. Set aside.</li><br>

                   <li> Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li><br>

                   <li><strong>Assemble the cinnamon rolls:</strong> On a lightly greased work surface press dough into a 10"x12" rectangle about 1/2" thick.</li><br>

                   <li>Position the dough so the long side is vertical. Sprinkle the filling evenly over the dough leaving a 1/2" strip  of dough bare at the top.</li><br>
 
                   <li>Start rolling the dough into a log starting with the filling-covered side.</li><br>

                  <li>Score the log into eight equal pieces (these will be large cinnamon rolls. For smaller ones divide into twelve). Using your sharpest knife cut the dough.</li><br>

				  <li>Place the cinnamon rolls onto prepared baking sheet, with at least 2" between each one and 2" away from the edge of the pan. To prevent the buns from unraveling tuck the ends of the spiral underneath the cinnamon rolls to hold them in place.</li><br>

                  <li>Cover the cinnamon rolls and let them proof for 30-60 minutes. They are ready when the dough is puffy and doesn't bounce back immediately when gently pressed.</li><br> 	
                  
				  <li>Position rack in the top third of the oven and preheat to 375°F.</li><br>
                  
				  <li>Bake the cinnamon rolls for 14-18 minutes, or until a digital thermometer inserted into the middle of the roll reads 190°F.</li><br>
                  
				  <li>Place pan on a rack and brush hot buns with 21g of melted butter. Let the cinnamon buns cool for 10 to 15 minutes before icing.</li><br>
				  
				  <li><strong>To make the icing:</strong> While buns are cooling combine the icing ingredients in a medium bowl, mixing until smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning.</li><br>
				  
				  <li>Ice the cinnamon rolls with an offset spatula and serve immediately. If you’re planning to serve the cinnamon rolls later, wait to ice them until just before serving. Store icing at room temperature, tightly covered, until you’re ready to use it.</li><br>
				  
				  <li>Store cooled cinnamon rolls, un-iced and well wrapped, for a couple of days at room temperature; or freeze for up to 1 month.</li><br>
