<p class="about"> I’ve spent most of my life in the kitchen, and for years, the fast-paced world of restaurants was my home. I started my culinary journey in Ottawa at a cozy spot called <strong><em>Town</em></strong>, where I learned the ins and outs of running a kitchen. From there, I had the incredible opportunity to help open  <strong><em>Corner Peach </em></strong> and its sister restaurant, <strong><em>Dukes</em></strong>, working alongside talented chefs and passionate people. Cooking professionally was demanding but deeply rewarding—it shaped me in ways I never expected.<br>  

After years of long hours and late nights, I decided it was time for a change. The restaurant industry had given me so much, but I found myself craving a different kind of challenge. That’s when I set my sights on becoming a <strong><em>Library and Information Technician</em></strong> The idea of organizing, preserving, and sharing knowledge in a new way excited me. It felt like a natural shift—after all, food and books both have a way of bringing people together.<br>  

Going back to school as a mature student has been an adventure of its own. It’s a different pace from the kitchen, but I’ve loved diving into the world of information management. Studying at <strong><em>Algonquin College</em></strong> has given me a fresh perspective, and I’m eager to apply my organizational skills in a new field. Libraries, much like kitchens, thrive on efficiency, creativity, and a deep respect for craft.<br>  

That said, cooking is still very much a part of my life. Now that I’m no longer working in a professional kitchen, I’ve rediscovered the joy of cooking at home. There’s something special about preparing a meal for friends and family, without the pressure of a dinner rush. I take my time, experiment with new recipes, and savor the process in a way I couldn’t when I was cooking for a packed restaurant. <br>

Food has always been about connection for me, and that hasn’t changed. Whether I’m making a simple pasta dish or slow-braising something special, the best part is gathering around the table with people I care about. I love introducing friends to new flavors, swapping stories over a home-cooked meal, and seeing the joy that good food brings.<br>  

Though my career path has shifted, I carry my experiences as a chef with me every day. The discipline, creativity, and attention to detail I honed in the kitchen continue to serve me well in my studies. I see my time in restaurants as an incredible chapter in my life—one that has led me to where I am now, embracing a new passion with the same dedication. <br> 

As I look ahead, I’m excited about the possibilities. Whether it’s in a library, an archive, or a research setting, I know I’ll find fulfillment in this next stage. But no matter where my career takes me, one thing is certain: my love for food, cooking, and sharing meals will always be a central part of who I am.
