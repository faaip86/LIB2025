				<p class="subtitle">These cookies were the result of a happy accident. (The best things always are, aren’t they?) When the peanut butter ran out, similarly creamy white miso stepped in. The other ingredients were tweaked to offset the miso’s savory character, and what came out of the oven was salty and sweet, crunchy and chewy. A brief stint in the fridge helps mellow the miso’s bracing brackishness, and a roll in Demerara sugar adds a subtle crunch that pairs well with the tender cookie.</p>

                <h1 class="page-title"><a href="cinnamon.html">Sourdough Cinnamon Rolls</a></h1>
				<p class="subtitle">We'd make these cinnamon buns every Saturday at the resturant, and they became a bit of a passion project to perfect. The recipe was based on one from <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/perfectly-pillowy-cinnamon-rolls-recipe"><strong>King Arthur Baking</strong></a>, but we wanted to make a sourdough version. This recipe is also a great way to use up discard from your sourdough starter. The yeast is doing the heavy lifting, so the starter is mostly there for flavor. The tanginess from the starter offsets the sweetness in the filling and frosting for a well-balanced bun. These buns take a while to make, but most of the time is spent waiting for the dough to rise—and they're well worth the wait!</p>
