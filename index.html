		  The picture for this recipe is actually from <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020538-peanut-butter-miso-cookies"><strong>NYT Cooking</strong></a>, but this recipe was actually the inspiration for these Sesame Miso cookies. I wanted something with a more pronounced savoriness so I landed on tahini instead of peanut butter. For a better look at the actual cookies, check out this video from the 
		   <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4yEbxug_UB/?igsh=MWtnYXo4MnlsZ3RubA=="><strong>Corner Peach</strong></a> Instagram page.
		  These cookies are salty and sweet, crunchy and chewy. Made with tahini, miso, brown sugar, and a ton of sesame seeds, they have a toasty, nutty flavour without being overly sweet. Great dipped in coffee!

				<p class="subtitle">This is a pretty versatile recipe. We use it for sandwich bread at 
          <a href="https://www.cornerpeach.com/"><strong>Corner Peach</strong></a> and 
          <a href="https://www.dukesottawa.com/"><strong>Dukes</strong></a>, and I've used it for burger buns or as the base of cinnamon rolls. 
          It freezes well and is incredibly forgiving. The sourdough starter in the recipe is optional — we just always had it on hand and found it added a little something different to the bread.

				<p class="subtitle">We'd make these cinnamon buns every Saturday at the resturant, and they became a bit of a passion project to perfect. The recipe was based on one from <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/perfectly-pillowy-cinnamon-rolls-recipe"><strong>King Arthur Baking</strong></a>, but we wanted to make a sourdough version. This recipe is also a great way to use up discard from your sourdough starter. The yeast is doing the heavy lifting, so the starter is mostly there for flavor. The tanginess from the starter offsets the sweetness in the filling and frosting for a well-balanced bun. These buns take a while to make, but most of the time is spent waiting for the dough to rise—and they're well worth the wait!</p>
